### Polynomial Simplifier

This branch has experimental code for simplifying more complex polynomials in multiple variables.
Due to the format of the arguments, each term can only have one coefficient. This was just a fun
little extension of the original project.

How it works: creates a list of term structs, then use hash table to combine
like terms, and then prints terms in sorted order.
